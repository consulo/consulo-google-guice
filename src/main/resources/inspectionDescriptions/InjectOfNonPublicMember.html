                This inspection reports any @com.google.inject.Inject annotations on non-'public' fields or methods.
                While Guice
                will be able to perform such injections in many cases (including most unit test scenarios), it may not
                be
                able to do so during deployment, due to security restrictions. In general, it is best to avoid such
                injection,
                either by public the injected field or method 'public' or, in the case of a field, creating a public
                setter and
                annotating it as @Inject.
