                This inspection reports any trivial explicit bindings. Trivial bindings simply declare that a class is
                implemented by
                itself, when the class doesn't have any conflicting @ImplementedBy or @ProvidedBy annotations. Such
                bindings are redundant, and may cause confusion as programs evolve.
